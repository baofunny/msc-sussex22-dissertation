# MSc Data Science Dissertation

This repo store the code for MSc Data Science Dissertation. There are 3 coding files:
1. Preparing-Data.ipynb: clean the data, split original data into sentence level and document level dataset. For each net dataset, we have traning dataset and validation dataset.

2. Fine-tuning.ipynb : this file fine-tuning pre-trained models with datasets processed in Preparing-Data.ipynb

3. Text-classification.ipynb : Apply fine-tuned model into testing dataset to do text classification. In this file, we do both document level and sentence level classification. At the final step, the file export the detail of the classification.
